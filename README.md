**Georgi Tasev**\
Flutter Developer | Mobile App Developer

Iâ€™m a passionate learner who combines creativity with technology. Outside of tech, I practice calisthenics and perform as a folklore dancer â€” both teach me discipline, adaptability, and patience. My focus as a developer is solving problems around usability and performance, and ensuring apps are safe, reliable, and stable for real users.
