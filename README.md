**Georgi Tasev**
Flutter Developer | Mobile App Developer

Iâ€™m a passionate learner who combines creativity with technology. Outside of tech, I practice calisthenics and perform as a folklore dancer â€” both teach me discipline, adaptability, and patience. My focus as a developer is solving problems around usability and performance, and ensuring apps are safe, reliable, and stable for real users.

# Projects

**FolkRobe â€“ Costume Inventory Management for Ensembles and Community Groups***(Still in Development)*

An app designed to answer a common but overlooked problem: How many costumes does an ensemble actually own, and who is currently using them?

**Key features:** 

â€¢ Add and organize costume parts into collections.
â€¢ Register active dancers and assign them temporary ownership of costumes for concerts/events.
â€¢ Offline-first design, ensuring ensembles can track inventory without constant internet access.

**Tech stack:**

â€¢ Flutter (Dart)
â€¢ SQLite (lightweight in-app storage)
â€¢ BloC (state management with custom events & state changes)
â€¢ Animations via AnimatedOpacity and AnimatedSlide
